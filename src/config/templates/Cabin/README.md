## What is this?

These are used by a separate Twig than the one used by Lens, to write
out configuration settings after they're changed by a user. This allows
us to have comments in our JSON file without them being obliterated
every time a user updates the settings from the web interface.

The symlinks should be generated automatically by your Airship install.
If they're checked in by our team, that's a bug.
